# Time-series-analysis-Case-1

## Problem description ##

A hydrological station on river X has been taking measures of its streamflow (in cubic kilometers). These
measurements are recorded for more than 20 years. The time series plot shown below indicates the varying of
water flow from Jan. 1997 to Dec. 2016. 

The data can be found here:

## Questions answered:

1) Develop a time series model to explain the data. Please clearly describe each step of your model building
process.
2) Report your modelâ€™s performance statistics, including MSE, MAD, and MAPE.
3) Forecast the future streamflow for the next 6 months after Dec. 2016.
